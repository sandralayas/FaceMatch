Final Response:
Face Recognition with Age, Gender, and Light Detection Filter
Introduction
This project is a real-time face recognition system that goes beyond simple detection. It processes a live video feed to not only identify faces but also to estimate the age and gender of individuals. A unique feature of this system is its ability to detect the ambient light intensity and apply a dynamic light-adjusting filter to the video stream, enhancing visibility in low-light conditions.
Features
 * Real-time Face Detection: Utilizes a robust deep learning model to accurately detect faces in a live video feed.
 * Age Estimation: Predicts the approximate age of detected individuals using a pre-trained classification model.
 * Gender Classification: Determines the gender (Male/Female) of each detected face.
 * Light Intensity Detection: Measures the brightness of the video frame to assess ambient lighting conditions.
 * Dynamic Light Filter: Automatically adjusts the brightness, contrast, or applies an overlay to the video feed based on the detected light intensity, improving visual clarity.
 * Live Annotations: Displays bounding boxes around faces along with estimated age, gender, and the current light level.
How It Works
The system operates in a pipeline of sequential steps on each frame of the video stream:
 * Video Capture: The application captures frames from the default webcam.
 * Face Detection: Each frame is passed to a pre-trained face detection model (e.g., Haar Cascades, MTCNN, or a model from OpenCV's DNN module) to find the coordinates of any faces.
 * Pre-processing: The detected face regions (ROIs) are extracted, resized, and normalized to the required input size for the age and gender models.
 * Age and Gender Prediction: The processed face ROIs are fed into two separate pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) modelsâ€”one for age classification and one for gender classification.
 * Light Detection: The overall brightness of the video frame is calculated (e.g., by converting the image to grayscale and averaging the pixel values).
 * Filter Application: Based on a predefined threshold for the light level, a light-adjusting filter (e.g., a simple gamma correction, a brightness/contrast adjustment, or an overlay) is applied to the entire frame.
 * Rendering: The original frame is annotated with the face bounding boxes, predicted age, and gender. The light-adjusted filter is then applied, and the final frame is displayed to the user.
Installation
Prerequisites
 * Python 3.x
 * pip (Python package installer)
Step-by-step Guide
 * Clone the Repository:
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project-name.git
cd your-project-name

 * Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):
   python -m venv venv
# On Windows
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate

 * Install Required Libraries:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

   The requirements.txt file should contain:
   * opencv-python
   * numpy
   * tensorflow (or pytorch)
   * scikit-learn (if used)
 * Download Pre-trained Models:
   Download the necessary .prototxt and .caffemodel files (or .h5/.pth for TensorFlow/PyTorch) for the face, age, and gender detection models. These files are not included in the repository due to their size. You can typically find them from public sources like the OpenCV GitHub repository or model zoos. Place them in the models/ directory.
   Example model files:
   * deploy.prototxt
   * res10_300x300_ssd_iter_140000.caffemodel
   * age_net.caffemodel
   * gender_net.caffemodel
Usage
To run the application, simply execute the main Python script from the command line:
python main.py


Technologies Used
 * Python
 * OpenCV: For video capture, image processing, and rendering.
 * TensorFlow/PyTorch: For running the deep learning models.
 * NumPy: For numerical operations.
